## What Happens When You Type `https://www.google.com` in Your Browser and Press Enter?

When you type `https://www.google.com` in your browser and press Enter, a series of complex processes take place. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### 1. DNS Request
The browser needs to resolve the domain name to an IP address. It first checks its cache and then the OS cache. If not found, it queries the ISP's DNS server, which may perform a recursive search to find the IP address.

### 2. TCP/IP
With the IP address in hand, the browser initiates a TCP connection using a three-way handshake process (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) over the IP protocol.

### 3. Firewall
Firewalls on both the client and server side check the packets to ensure they comply with security rules before allowing the connection.

### 4. HTTPS/SSL
The browser initiates an SSL/TLS handshake to establish a secure connection. This involves a series of steps to exchange keys and authenticate the server using its SSL certificate.

### 5. Load Balancer
The request may pass through a load balancer that distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.

### 6. Web Server
The load balancer forwards the request to a web server, which handles static content or forwards dynamic content requests to an application server.

### 7. Application Server
For dynamic content, the web server forwards the request to an application server, which processes server-side code to generate the response.

### 8. Database
The application server may query a database to retrieve or update information needed to fulfill the request. It uses SQL/NoSQL queries to interact with the database.

### Conclusion
After processing, the application server sends the response back through the web server and load balancer, and eventually back to the browser. The browser renders the response, displaying the web page.

This detailed workflow highlights the complexity and collaboration of various web components working together to deliver a seamless web browsing experience.
